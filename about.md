# About Me

I'm a technical leader who stays close to the code while building high-performing teams. My approach is deeply influenced by **Cal Newport's** focus on *deep work* and **Marcus Buckingham's** emphasis on *leveraging individual strengths*.

## How I Work

- **Code-first leadership**: I mentor through design reviews, code contributions, and focused collaboration
- **Hands-on at scale**: Even while managing, I ship Go services, own runbooks/on-call, and build internal tools
- **Strengths-enabled teams**: I create environments where engineers thrive by identifying and amplifying individual strengths
- **Technical ownership**: I maintain deep technical credibility through architecture, performance tuning, and incident response
- **Async-first communication**: Clear docs, focused issue threads, and concise reviews enable deep work across timezones

## Team Philosophy

Building teams where:
- Deep, uninterrupted work is protected and valued
- Roles are shaped around individual strengths rather than generic templates
- Processes enable focus rather than create friction
- Knowledge sharing accelerates through documentation and async collaboration

## Skills

- **Primary**: Go, Python
- **Systems & Architecture**: Distributed systems, microservices, high-throughput pipelines, performance optimization, observability
- **Infrastructure & Tooling**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Postgres, CI/CD, Prometheus/Grafana, Unix tooling & debugging
- **Languages**: C/C++; TypeScript (learning), Rust (learning), Kotlin (learning)
- **Specialized**: Cryptographic primitives, off-chain payments (Cashu)
- **Collaboration**: Remote-first leadership, async communication, code review culture, developer experience

## What I'm Exploring

- Scaling deep work practices in growing engineering organizations
- Strengths-based approaches to technical career development
- Practical applications of cryptography in payment systems
- Developer experience optimizations that enable sustained focus

Let's connect if you're building teams where deep work and individual strengths drive exceptional outcomes.
