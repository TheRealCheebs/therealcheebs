# Cheebs

Backend-focused software engineer and hands-on engineering leader with 10+ years building distributed systems, cloud platforms, and large-scale backend services. Nearly eight years at a Fortune 50 company where I progressed from senior engineer to senior manager while remaining deeply technical and contributor-focused.

[Resume](./Resume.md)

TL;DR: I ship code, design systems, and lead teams. I combine individual contributor technical credibility with practical engineering leadership: mentoring through code, driving architecture, and resolving production incidents.

## What I'm building (2025–present)

- Independent open-source work focused on nostr and Cashu related tooling and infrastructure. Projects are currently unfunded and experimental. Happy to discuss collaboration or funding to accelerate development.
