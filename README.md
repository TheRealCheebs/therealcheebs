# Cheebs

Backend-focused software engineer and hands-on engineering leader with 10+ years building distributed systems, cloud platforms, and large-scale backend services. Nearly eight years at a Fortune 50 company where I progressed from senior engineer to senior manager while remaining deeply technical and contributor-focused.

TL;DR: I ship code, design systems, and lead teams. I combine individual-contributor technical credibility with practical engineering leadership — mentoring through code, driving architecture, and resolving production incidents.

## How I work (short)

 - Code-first leader: I mentor and influence through design reviews, code contributions, and focused collaboration.
- Hands-on at scale: even while managing, I shipped Go services, owned runbooks/on-call, and built internal tools used in production.
- Cross-functional operator: worked closely with QA, Ops, Product, PM, and external partners to deliver complex features.
- Technical IC credibility: I retain deep technical ownership — architecture, performance tuning, and critical incident response.
 - Prefer remote/distributed teams and async communication — clear docs, issue threads, and concise reviews help me move work forward across timezones.

## What I'm building (2025–present)

- Independent open-source work focused on nostr and Cashu-related tooling and infrastructure. Projects are currently unfunded and experimental — happy to discuss collaboration or funding to accelerate development. Links to active repos and demos can be found on my GitHub.
